# Party Planner

This is a simple web app I made to plan parties with coworkers.

It uses Firebase as a database to store suggested locations for upcoming parties and the number of votes for each of these locations.

The front end was build with React, using create-react-app and Bootstrap to speed up the development process.

## Motivation

After reading a tutorial on how to use Firebase as an online database, I wanted to put it to use to cement what I had learned.

My coworkers and I had recently been having trouble deciding where to go drinking the following weekend, as we often worked different schedules. I decided this was a good opportunity to use Firebase and to practice using React more.

The site allows my coworkers to submit any suggestions for places to go. We can then vote on these to try to reach a decision.
